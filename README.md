This is a remaking of the classic NES game Duck Hunt using jQuery. 

I initially made the ducks animate, fly across the screen from a random height and react to being shot. Later I added code to limit the number of shots that can be fired per round, as well as detracting lives for each duck that successfully makes it across to the other side of the screen. Later more visual feedback was added such as a score counter, a bullet counter and a gunshot flash.
